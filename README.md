This is a simulation project for dynamic workspace allocation in a medium-sized tech company.  
There's real-world constraints such as employee hierarchy, workspace types, and department-specific requests,etc included in the code.

## Features

- Theres a L1 to L5 employee hierarchy
- Multiple workspace types: private cabins, hot desks, meeting rooms, etc.
- Priority-based allocation logic (Feel free to add your own)
- CSV generation for test data and results.

Detailed assumptions about the hierarchy, workspace distribution, and labeling are available in the documentation.
