# Workspace-Requests-Sim
This Python program generates a synthetic dataset simulating workspace booking requests in a corporate environment. It creates records, each representing an employeeâ€™s request for a workspace based on their hierarchy level, department, and workspace preferences. The final dataset is saved as a CSV file for further analysis or modeling.
